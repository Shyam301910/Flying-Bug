# FLYING BUG
We have designed this game in GitHub Game Off 2021 event on 'bug' theme. We had a team of 4 members: Sanyam Sharma, Kesav Santhosh, Shyam Sankalp Pattnaik and Akshit Jain.

# ABOUT GAME
Flying bug is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bug, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating the bug through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights.

## Functions defined in the game
We have created four functions in python, that are welcomeScreen that shows welcome images on the screen, mainGame that is responsible for complete movement of objects in the game, isCollide that comes into act when the bug collides, and getRandomPipe function that generates positions of two pipes (one bottom straight and one top rotated) for blitting on the screen randomly using random function (defined in library named 'random').
